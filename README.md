# E-Commerce-Platform

##Problem

The primary objective of this system is to simulate an e-commerce shopping platform similar to Amazon. Due to time constraints, the system will focus primarily on core functionalities related to ordering, including order placement, inventory management, and order tracking. Secondary features, such as payment processing, will be implemented using simplified approaches.
